                their territory â€” and so when stalking them, half the battle is merely getting near enough to strike.
                Leshens old enough to earn the appellation "ancient" wield advanced skills and tactics that make them
                particularly dangerous. </p>

                between these two types of scavengers - unlike witchers, who know that the alghoul is a more
                aggressive and challenging opponent.
