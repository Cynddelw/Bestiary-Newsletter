*Pro Tip: In April 2018, Gmail released an updated interface for their webmail client. 
This new interface uses two popular web fonts: Google Sans and Roboto. 
What does this mean? Despite Gmail not supporting web fonts, if you use either of these web fonts in your emails, they will actually render in Gmail. 
Simply add the fonts to your font-family CSS attribute if you want to use them in your email.
